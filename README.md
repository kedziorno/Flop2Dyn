# PyFloGen - VHDL Generation for FloPoCo and Dynamatic Integration

PyFloGen is an advanced toolkit for generating VHDL code for floating-point operations, specifically tailored for integration with Dynamatic, an academic, open-source high-level synthesis compiler. This tool automates the process of creating VHDL modules via FloPoCo, making it seamless to incorporate floating-point computations in Dynamatic's dynamically-scheduled circuits generated from C/C++ code.

## Features

- Automated VHDL code generation compatible with FloPoCo.
- Custom wrapper generation for seamless integration with Dynamatic.
- Support for a variety of floating-point operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Command-line interface for adaptable and dynamic usage.
- Simulation and testbench generation for robust testing and validation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- FloPoCo (Floating Point Core Generator) installed and accessible in your PATH.

### Installation

1. Clone the PyFloGen repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PyFloGen.git
